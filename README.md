## Abstract

The present repository hosts the codebase for the Voice Tech TO workshop [cross platform for voice application](https://www.meetup.com/voice-tech-to/events/259425746/).

Voice Tech TO has been hosting a series of meetup on how to build a voice application using the best practices for product design and development.

After ideation sessions, we have decided to build a voice application to help consumers improve and practice their english through a voice application.

## Description

For this workshop we will work on using [Jovo](https://www.jovo.tech/) to create our voice application both on Alexa and Google Assistant.
The aim of the workshop is to understand how to mutualize the backend for multiple Voice platform.
